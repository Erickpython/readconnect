            <p> Recognizing that many children struggle with basic reading skills, the initiative began with a focus on providing access to quality reading materials, play-based learning and digital literacy training methods.</p>
            <p>Since its inception, <strong>Read Connect</strong> has actively engaged students through storybooks reading, peer tutoring, and interactive board games like Scrabble, chess and Monopoly. The project continues to evolve, with a strong commitment to empowering educators and fostering a supportive learning community, aiming to expand its reach to more schools and communities in the future. </p>
